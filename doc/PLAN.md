# Game Plan
## Muthu Arivoli


### Breakout Variant
I particularly enjoyed the pinball version of breakout. I enjoyed the level of complexity that came with having an extra component in play, and especially enjoyed how the velocity of the ball changed after begin struck by the pinball arrow.
### General Level Descriptions
The first level will have about 4 rows and 10 columns of bricks, mostly regular bricks, but a few that will take more hits to break.
The second level will have about 6 rows and 10 columns, with a mix of all types of bricks, and will have some space between certain adjacent rows of bricks.
The third level will have about 8 rows and 10 columns of bricks and will contain more of the bricks that take more hits to break.
### Bricks Ideas
For the various types of bricks, I would like to implement one that is worth twice as many points as the original. The original will probably be worth 10 points, so this brick will be worth 20 points. Another brick I would like  to implement is a brick that will take more hits to break, probably being 1 or 2 more hits (depending on how difficult it is to finish the game with more hits) than a regular brick, which takes one hit to break. Another brick I would like to implement is one that creates multiple balls once it is broken.
### Power Up Ideas
I would like to implement one powerup that increases the paddle length to approximately 20-50% longer than it was before. This effect should decay after a certain short amount of time. Another powerup I would like to implement will allow for the points being gained to be doubled for a short amount of time after being activated. Another powerup is one that speeds up the paddle, meaning it allows the player to move the paddle faster than without the powerup. I will also create another powerup that will speed up the ball for a short amount of time.
### Cheat Key Ideas
I plan on implementing cheat key L, which will add additional lives to the player. I will also implement key R, which will reset ball and paddle to their starting position. I will also implement cheat keys that will send the player to the level specified by the cheat key. I will also implement a key that will destroy a random block on each press.
### Something Extra
I would like to implement the pinball arms from the pinball variant of of breakout. This is substantial as it will allow for a way for the player to control the response of the y-velocity of the ball from the arm, thus causing more dynamic speeds.
